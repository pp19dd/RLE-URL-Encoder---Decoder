RLE URL Encoder/Decoder

Is a tiny PHP and JavaScript library that decodes/encodes (and shrinks) 
long query strings (ie: country checkboxes) with simple run-length encoding

This library is intended to shrink long URLs from something like:

?country[]=Algeria&country[]=Angola&country[]=Barbados... (and few hundred more.)

Into a predictable, short-encoded version such as:

?c=a81ja104ja11
